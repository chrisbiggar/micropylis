One of the main goals of porting micropolis is to 
understand a semi-complex simulation system:
        - city transportation network
        - rci demand

Next:
- try putting all tiles in batch only once.
    - signal which tiles to update when something changes; only update specific tiles.
    - try using opengl functions: glTranslatef.
        - need to set up opengl viewport probobly
        - might be too slow to update the whole maps tiles every frame
            - might need to update all tiles with 16 pixel tile size and maximized window,
                but with keeping track and only updating certain tiles, might not be too slow.
        - keep track of which tiles are in view and only actively update those,
            - also would need to update tiles when viewport is changed
            - use events
    
-------------   Plan For Micropylis Development  --------------

- set up git and start versioning ********
- get simple gui going
    - make mockup
    - use modified version of kytten
        - all controls can go in kytten dialogs
            - tool select
            - pause/play
            - save/load/new
            - info
- make simulation work part by part
    - decide first part (residential and roads?) (map scanning?)  ******

-----------  BUGS  -----------

- half of bottom row of tiles are cut off
        
---------- Q 'n A -----------

- what does band do in Engine.simulate()?
    -
