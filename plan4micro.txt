window now resizable. infopane will resize itself. fullscreen mode now availible. improved message pane.


- where is sega genesis??

----- WHAT TO DO NEXT -----

- etc dir still in repo. remove this!

- fix toolstroke to do autobulldoze properly.

- change code to use xrange when possible.

-FIX: month starts at dec 1990 and wraps around to jan 1990

- general city messages should be restricted from repeating within a certain timeframe.

- msgpane: make more efficient by cleaning up and appending and removing text from document. may have to use html or something for formatting.
    - have to store index's into doc string.

- dynamic layout containers
    - look at kytten

- powersystem final details
    - impl checkpowermap for loading saves
    - repair zone not working. (progressivly moving zone south-east)
    - onpower not working
        - repair zone! is not working but seems to fix this.
    - when changing tile of zone with no power, tileindicator does not go away
        - need to call a destory zone function. (like what would be called when you bulldoze key tile of zone)


THEN:
- figure out next steps by mapping out what engine does and seeing bigger picture of simulation.



-------------   Plan For Micropylis Dev --------------

- mouse wheel scroll!! (on mouse point)

- give description comment for ambiguious methods in source!!!!!!
- comment every class briefly on what it does.

- make window resizable
    - make code for laying out infopane upon resize
        - below certain window size pane should disappear.

        - things to lay-out: two frames(viewingpane and infopane), and one message display box, and 3 text labels.
            - use kytten for example.
            - date,funds,population,msgpane.

        - containers and items. each container has list of items that it lays out inside itself according to rules for alignment and order. vertical and horizontal and possibly grid layouts can be used. constrictions like on a certain item's width can be used.
            - horizontal layout used for viewingpane and infopane: infopane has minimum or static width and viewingpane will fit the rest of the screen left.

- simulation engine
    - study the source code more: write down any findings about how things work.
    - outline the different systems that make the city alive so you can see what to do next and what you are doing in relation to everything else.

- when working on engine simulation
    - a test: zones growing
        - number of different systems contribute to this.
            - make map of different systems and how they relate?
    - test you methods as you go!
        - real unit tests?
    - jot down notes about simulation for more specific parts.



---------- GUI LIST ---------------

- info panel.
    - buttons - highlight and display hand when hover. click will show indication of click.
        - button that opens main menu dialog
            - main menu: new,load,save,options,about
        - population is button that opens cityevaldialog
        - date is button that opens graphs (how to show graphs?)
        - funds is button that opens budgetdialog

    - minimap
        - 360px wide, 300px tall in original (3px per tile)
        - somehow copy and scale the regular map for this?
        - could have slower updates than regular map for speed.
        - how to do this minimap and overlays?

- sounds
    - orig music
    - zone placement

- some gui items to be made:
    - demand indicator
    - new city
    - save/load
    - budget dialog
    - city eval dialog
    - about dialog


-----------  BUGS  -----------

4b: when panning map and mouse cursor is cross hair if dragging off the map or in certain situations it will not turn back to a normal cursor

5:(verify this is still happening...) when placing or dragging a tool higher than or left of the map, the tool will draw outside the map and wrap around to other side of map, setting the tiles in those spots to black, and the spot outside the map to the value of those tiles. (tile sprite coords are being moved to values outside of the map)
