commit notes:
Version 2
created tool system.
viewing pane shows tool preview and cursor.
added infopane to show city information.
created script to create tool icon grid.
beginnings of mapscanning and tile behaviours in place.


----- STATE OF DEV -----

DO COMMIT!!!

- pretty tool buttons grid!
    - include pan tool icon
    - load imagegrid and tool order file, then assign imagegrid peices to paletteoptions
    - put all tool types in micropolistools

- laywire (after doing the tool button)
- bulldozer tool

- start working on engine map scanning


------ More Things:

*- toolstroke applyzone() water = tool result NONE 

- the rest of the tools

*- incorporate makeicons into main build script
    - change names of these to "gen graphics"

*- placing zones should be restricted to 2 zones thick either direction



-------------   Plan For Micropylis Dev   --------------

- work on engine simulation
    - test mapscan
    - continue working on behaviours
    - residential and roads
    - focus on a couple things: roads, res, industrial?
        - get proof of concepts going eg. residential zone growing 
    - census stuff

- learn how to do profiling

- gui
    - message display box
        - better background
        - needs to auto resize itself
            - stay same width?
            - need to figure this out.

    - info panel.
        - resize itself.
        - buttons for kytten dialogs
        - can be minimized?
        - minimap is 360 px wide
            - how to do minimap and overlays?

    - sounds

    - other things
        - new city
        - pause/play
        - save/load
        - budget dialog
        - city eval

- loading screen (getting tiles ready)
    - will display game screen with display panel and in area where map will
        be it will display a loading bar
    - have lightweight scene manager
        - either (can create a "process" and add draw and update functions to it)
        - or (scene manager where a scene object will subclass Scene)
        - viewingpane will only process a certain amount at a time, and report back its completion and progres
            - this scene will update a progress bar and display an animation.


-----------  BUGS  -----------

1: PaletteMenu or Option does not pass mouse move event to parent dialog (should probobly do this)

2: when in 8 size tile, view is wider than map.
    centre map and have a border.
3: in addition to bug #2, map needs to be adjusted
    when changed zoom lvls so it is not off centre

4: when tool is dragged off map, tool does not actually place.
    - has to do with on tool up not happening

----------------  Extraneous Things --------------

- get self containing exe working

- get music from original.

- improve tiles!

- tool cursor in viewingpane
    - tool cursor uses sprite (will need peices for middles and ends, vertical and horizontal + sizes) (or look at how kytten makes dynamic boxes using single image**)

- build maker
    - install tool (start menu shortcut)
    - copies everything for a release to a release directory
        - this needs testing!
        - python code into a self contained executable
    - uses a simple build script
        - directories, files, other scripts to run (maketiles)
        - excluded extensions
    - pack all tile data including tiles.rc in single file
        - header, tiles.rc, and tilesheet pngs
        - header data: signature, format version, number of sizes followed by each size's number, length of tiles.rc
        - implement for icons and sprite images

-----------  NOTES  -----------

- kytten container that has no background and/or cannot be moved
        - try container?

- Micropolis is simple!
    - just does simulation (mapscanning and census) in the switch-case of the simulate() function. then stuff is added to map with tool classes. sprites are animated.
    - class functionailities can be split into:
        - Mapscanning
            - TileBehaviour,
            - mapscanner
            - terrainbehaviour
            - things that help with this
                - TrafficGen
                - tiles, tilespec
        - Evaluation and Census
            - Cityeval
            - citybudget
            - cityproblem
        - tools for modiying the map
            - start with tool
            - RoadLikeTool
            - bulldozer
            - translatedtooleffect
        - Sprites
            - airplane, monster, tornado

- a very dense large city would cause slowdowns due to updating the batch
    - will need to mess with updating of changed tiles.
    - for more effiency: keep track of which tiles that are in view and only actively update those
        - will need to update tiles after scrolling or window size change
    - window size might need to be limited (too many tiles will need constant updating in a large city)

- Toolstrokes are "always draws down". so when draging tool down, y[start] always stays the same and height increases. when dragging up y increases as well as height. start is always at top of line.

---------- Q 'n A -----------

- how does it determine which zones are linked together (for transportation and power etc.)
    - in behaviour class it follows road from zone to see if it can get somewhere usefull

---------- GOALS -----------

One of the main goals of porting micropolis is to 
understand a semi-complex simulation system:
    - city transportation network
    - rci demand
