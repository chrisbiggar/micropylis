commit log:
v4
-----
speed controls. modified viewingpane to only create sprite data once per map and to only change the image for existing sprites. modified pyglet texturegrid to store tile items as animations according to tilesrc. animations now are automatically handled by pyglet and animation speed is controlled with a custom time func for pyglet clock instance. pyglet sprite class was modified to allow a clock other than the default. started implementing tile behaviours with the fire tile behaviour.

------
made window resizable. infopane will resize itself.
added date and population label to infopane.
----- STATE OF DEV -----

Do commit soon

- infopanel layout stuff!! order date,funds,population

- simulation engine *****
    - impl. speed control for engine.
    - code power system
        - ** do main system, then blink. do the tools somewhere inbetween.
        - blink
            - animation toggling between blank and power symbol
        - building tool
        - laywire

- comment every ambiguious method in source

- ? make right click drag pan view. right click without drag queries tile.

-------------   Plan For Micropylis Dev --------------

- envision and make mockup for final vision of what micropylis will be! label and make notes.

- work on engine simulation
    - when making lots of new methods, each one should be tested to stop confusion when putting it all together
        - real unit tests?
    - jot down notes about simulation as you go.

- going to need to optimize, but will be doable!
    - updateView() for updating only the tiles seen on the screen; will be called when scrolling(only when every few new tiles have been reached) on_map changed only updates tiles within screen. call less periodically when zoomed out?
    - learn how to do profiling

- gui
    - make window resizable (easy!)
        - do in test program first
        - everything relative to its size
        - gui components resize themselves.
        - 0ther glitches?
        - minimum size restriction
        - fullscreen?

    - info panel.
        - should cleanly layout itself independant of size
        - add title label at top of message queue: Info
        - resize itself.
        - buttons for kytten dialogs
        - can be minimized?
        - message display box
            - better background (image?)(like kytten and cursor)
            - needs to auto resize itself
                - stay same width?
                - need to figure this out.

        - minimap is 360 px wide
            - scale the regular map very small?
            - how to do minimap and overlays?

    - sounds
        - orig music
        - zone placement

    - some GUI items:
        - new city
        - pause/play
        - save/load
        - budget dialog
        - city eval


-----------  BUGS  -----------

1: PaletteMenu or Option does not pass mouse move event to parent dialog (should probobly do this)

4: when tool is dragged off map, tool does not actually place.
    - has to do with "on tool up" not happening

5: when placing or dragging a tool higher than or left of the map, the tool will draw outside the map and wrap around to other side of map, setting the tiles in those spots to black, and the spot outside the map to the value of those tiles. (tile sprite coords are being moved to values outside of the map)

6: When changing a tile for first time, there is a slowdown; program stops for a split second. changes after that do not seem to impact speed.
